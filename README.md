# podcast-catalog-api

## What's This?

This is a Hapi.js API built as an exercise.

## Running the API

To get started, clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saidur2k/podcast-catalog-api.git
```

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, then install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Lastly, run the API.

```bash
npm start
```

You can also run the API in development mode to get automatic server restarts with Nodemon.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

Note: replace npm with yarn :)
